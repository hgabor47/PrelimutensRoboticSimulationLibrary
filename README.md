# Prelimutens Robotic Simulation Library 

Alpha stage: main functions working
[Documentation, examples, videos](https://github.com/hgabor47/PrelimutensRoboticSimulationLibrary.git)

This library is the Arduino side of our Blender <-> Arduino Robotic Simulation interface (aka PreliRobotic) 

You can use the Blender 3D 2.8 system for simulate 3D environment for your robotic device.
With this lightweight lib you can communicate with the Blender side addon and you can control your built device in the Blender.
The virtual device building is a less complicate method and described in our site.
 
You need to use ESP8266 device in this version as a robot brain.
